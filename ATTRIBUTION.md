## Fork Enhancements

### What We Added
- **Full OpenCode Support**: Complete integration with OpenCode's usage tracking
- **Dual Source Tracking**: Distinguish between OpenCode `[O]` and Claude Code `[C]` usage
- **Project-Based Reporting**: New `project` command for project-level analysis
- **Enhanced Live Monitoring**: Improved real-time dashboard features
- **Advanced Filtering**: Enhanced date and project filtering capabilities
- **Unified Data Loading**: Combined data processing for both platforms

### Why We Forked
While the original ccusage project excellently serves Claude Code users, the introduction of OpenCode by Anthropic created a need for:

1. **Unified Tracking**: Both OpenCode and Claude Code use the same Claude models and API
2. **Source Distinction**: Users need to see usage from both platforms separately
3. **Enhanced Analytics**: Project-based reporting and advanced monitoring
4. **Specialized Features**: Features specific to dual-platform usage patterns

This fork maintains full compatibility with the original ccusage while adding these essential features for users of both OpenCode and Claude Code.

## License Compatibility

Both the original ccusage and this fork (occusage) are released under the MIT License, ensuring full compatibility and proper attribution.

## Acknowledgments

We deeply appreciate the excellent foundation provided by [@ryoppippi](https://github.com/ryoppippi) and all contributors to the original ccusage project. This fork builds upon their outstanding work to serve the growing OpenCode community while maintaining support for Claude Code users.
